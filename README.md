# 100daysOfcoding
Log file of next 100 days of code work including learning via courses, books, and individual projects.

##DAY 8 (9/11/18): 1. Completed lecture 61 in the RP course working on the m-city project and started prep for coding challenge #9.  

##DAY 8 (9/10/18): 1. Completed lecture 60 in the RP course working on the m-city project; updated DB images for the m_city team project to accurate match prop name between DB and storage; found root error in impropr use of this on props when passing props directly to the component, which seemed to be the entire cause of the error messages.  Also found a few small syntax errors that might have affect the outcome but since they were found first before the errors stopped, not quite sure of the effect.  Nevertheless, allitems in project are fully functional now.  Lastly, in addition to completed the course lecture, I reviewed the RP material for today plus the prior two days to ensure that I more thoroughly understood the process for creating these components.

##DAY 7(9/09/18): 1. Completed lecture 56-59the RP course working on the m-city project; after completing these sections though, the player images are now uploading and storing properly in the DB.  Next work will be to trouble shoot the errors.

##DAY 6 (9/8/18): 1. Completed lecture 54-55 in the RP course working on the m-city project; 2, did research on coding challenges sites, while I found a number of them decided to user coderbyte.com as source for daily work to solve at least one challenge a day.  Todays challenge was on factorial functions. 3. Read docs for using Nodemailer in projects.

##DAY 5 (9/7/18): 1. Completed lecture 49-53 in the RP course working on the m-city project; 2. Continued reading text books through SBO on React and Redux; however, found the example projects either lacking or difficult to follow in there presentation of code on their website, as such decided not to renew subscription and will use the resources documentation pages directly to better learn the proper usage formulas.

##DAY 4 (9/6/18):
    1. Completed lecture 48 in the RP course working on the m-city project; then, lectures 94-99 in J2SD, learning without code along work; next, lectures 11-16 in AdvCSS...learning only too.  Used subscription to read aterial for deeper understanding of state (chap 3.1 in React in Action) as well as redux (chap2 until listing 2.14 in Redux in Action).

##DAY 3 (9/5/18):
    1.Completed lectures 46-47 in React Practice Course; 2: The Bundling and begin of the performance sections in Junior to Senior Dev (J2SD) course, lectures 83 - 93; then spent the majority of my remaining time on coding, which was about 2-3 hours attempting to read and understand others code in an open source project. Attempted to make some changes to allow a searchbox feature to work, but unresolved yet.

##DAY 2 (9/4/18):
    1: Completed lectures 43-45 in React Practice Course; 2: The Redux section in Junior to Senior Dev course, lectures 77 - 82; 3: Finished lectures 8-10 in Natours project for Advanced CSS.  Did outside research reading from J to S dev course resources on roadmaps...probably spent more time looking for items then actually learning material, but did find some good resources for future reference such as exploring ES2018 and ES2019.

##Day 1 (September 3, 2018): 
  1: Finished lectures 41 and 42 in React Practice(RP) Course; 2: The Redux section in Junior to Senior Dev(J2SD) course, lectures 77 - 82; 3: The Recusrion section of Algorithms, lectures 47-49; and 4: Started Natours project in Advanced CSS(AdvCSS), working through lectures 4-7.
