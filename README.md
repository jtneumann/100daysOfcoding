# 100daysOfcoding
Log file of next 100 days of code work including learning via courses, books, and individual projects.

##DAY 1 (11/16/18):  Restarted after stopping work to focus on income generation.  1. Advanced CSS: completed section 4 by doing lectures 26-29.

****************************************************************************************************************************************

##DAY 17 (10/05/18) 1: Completed section 11-Buble sort in the js-algorithms-and-data-structures course.

##DAY 16 (10/03/18) Took the past two weeks off from coding to focus further on current full-time work, which required extra hours to complete than expected.  Nevertheless, endeavoring to return to at least some daily code to both maintain current skills as well as gain new knowledge.  1: Reviewed lecture(s) 25- First Steps with Sass: Mixins, Extends and Functions in Advanced CSS course.

##DAY 15 (9/22/18) 1: Reviewed lectures 80-84 in RP course.

##DAY 14 (9/21/18) 1: Reviewed lectures 76-79 in RP course.

##DAY 13 (9/19/18) 1: Reviewed lectures 73-75 in RP course.

##DAY 12 (9/17/18): 1: Completed lectures 22-29 in Natours project for Advanced CSS.

##DAY 11 (9/16/18): 1: Finished lectures 17-21 in Natours project for Advanced CSS.

##DAY 10 (9/14/18): 1. Completed lectures 157-163 in the RP course, specifically added a file upload, file download and forgot password function to the waves project. Project now complete will turn to focusing on improving CSS skills and strengthen algorithm solutions.  Also, continued reading on threejs.org library, but have not decided on a project build or even if I will have enough knowledge to enter the #9 code challenge.

##DAY 9 (9/13/18): 1. Completed lectures 152-156 in the RP course on the waves project, specifically finished the Nodemailer set-up and added an ORDER ID function to purchase component.  Note: the lectures used a fake gmail account to send and receive, yet I chose to try to use the Ethereal test mail accounts, but was not able to get that function to work properly yet.

##DAY 8 (9/12/18): 1. Completed lectures 62-66 in the RP course...m-city project now ready for deployment.  However, after attempting to create a dotenv file for the firebase-config keys, I was unable to get the firebase.js file to access the DB.  Kept getting a database undefined error.  I spent a few hours trying multiple different setups and searching the net for possible solutions, but was unsuccessful.  I also tried a deep-dive into the docs for firebase, but they seemed significantly lacking...lack could be due to my inexperience too though.  Nevertheless, today felt like a waste; hours upon hours spent on an task without ever reaching a resolution.

##DAY 8 (9/11/18): 1. Completed lecture 61 in the RP course working on the m-city project and started prep for coding challenge #9.  

##DAY 8 (9/10/18): 1. Completed lecture 60 in the RP course working on the m-city project; updated DB images for the m_city team project to accurate match prop name between DB and storage; found root error in impropr use of this on props when passing props directly to the component, which seemed to be the entire cause of the error messages.  Also found a few small syntax errors that might have affect the outcome but since they were found first before the errors stopped, not quite sure of the effect.  Nevertheless, allitems in project are fully functional now.  Lastly, in addition to completed the course lecture, I reviewed the RP material for today plus the prior two days to ensure that I more thoroughly understood the process for creating these components.

##DAY 7(9/09/18): 1. Completed lecture 56-59the RP course working on the m-city project; after completing these sections though, the player images are now uploading and storing properly in the DB.  Next work will be to trouble shoot the errors.

##DAY 6 (9/8/18): 1. Completed lecture 54-55 in the RP course working on the m-city project; 2, did research on coding challenges sites, while I found a number of them decided to user coderbyte.com as source for daily work to solve at least one challenge a day.  Todays challenge was on factorial functions. 3. Read docs for using Nodemailer in projects.

##DAY 5 (9/7/18): 1. Completed lecture 49-53 in the RP course working on the m-city project; 2. Continued reading text books through SBO on React and Redux; however, found the example projects either lacking or difficult to follow in there presentation of code on their website, as such decided not to renew subscription and will use the resources documentation pages directly to better learn the proper usage formulas.

##DAY 4 (9/6/18):
    1. Completed lecture 48 in the RP course working on the m-city project; then, lectures 94-99 in J2SD, learning without code along work; next, lectures 11-16 in AdvCSS...learning only too.  Used subscription to read aterial for deeper understanding of state (chap 3.1 in React in Action) as well as redux (chap2 until listing 2.14 in Redux in Action).

##DAY 3 (9/5/18):
    1.Completed lectures 46-47 in React Practice Course; 2: The Bundling and begin of the performance sections in Junior to Senior Dev (J2SD) course, lectures 83 - 93; then spent the majority of my remaining time on coding, which was about 2-3 hours attempting to read and understand others code in an open source project. Attempted to make some changes to allow a searchbox feature to work, but unresolved yet.

##DAY 2 (9/4/18):
    1: Completed lectures 43-45 in React Practice Course; 2: The Redux section in Junior to Senior Dev course, lectures 77 - 82; 3: Finished lectures 8-10 in Natours project for Advanced CSS.  Did outside research reading from J to S dev course resources on roadmaps...probably spent more time looking for items then actually learning material, but did find some good resources for future reference such as exploring ES2018 and ES2019.

##Day 1 (September 3, 2018): 
  1: Finished lectures 41 and 42 in React Practice(RP) Course; 2: The Redux section in Junior to Senior Dev(J2SD) course, lectures 77 - 82; 3: The Recusrion section of Algorithms, lectures 47-49; and 4: Started Natours project in Advanced CSS(AdvCSS), working through lectures 4-7.
